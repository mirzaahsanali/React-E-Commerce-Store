# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How to Initialize a Git Repository in Your Project

### Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop

1. **Open GitHub Desktop.**
2. Go to `File` > `Add Local Repository...`
3. Select your project folder.
4. If it says “This directory does not appear to be a Git repository,” you’ll see an option to **Create a Repository**.
5. Click **Create a Repository**.
6. Fill in the repository name (e.g., `zeesh-ecommerce`), description, and select the local path (your project folder).
7. Click **Create Repository**.

Now your folder is a Git repository, and you can proceed to **Publish repository** to GitHub as described earlier.

---

### Option 2: Using Command Line (if you prefer)

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd "D:\Web Work\HOP Course\ZEESH.com\Project Z"
   ```
3. Run:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
4. Go back to GitHub Desktop and add the local repository again.

---

**After initializing, you’ll be able to commit and push your project to GitHub using GitHub Desktop.**
